# Node-ToDo-API
This is a NODE REST API that I created for any developer to utilize in order to make an application that keeps a list of "todo" notes. The API has full CRUD capabilities where users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete the todo notes that they have made. All of the information created by the API is stored in a MongoDB database. The API is built with ES6 JavaScript and JSON, while using node packages like mongodb, mongoose, express, body-parser, lodash, validator, and jsonwebtokens. There are also several dev dependencies for testing like mocha, expect, and supertest.

Below I will show some examples of the API functionality and routes using Postman. I will be using the URL of the API that I have deployed to heroku which is: https://todoapi1221.herokuapp.com/
